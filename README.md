Breast Cancer Prediction using k-NN

Overview

This project implements a breast cancer prediction model using the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm with the Breast Cancer Coimbra Dataset. The model classifies patients into two categories: healthy (0) or cancerous (1) based on clinical features. The project showcases data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning model evaluation using scikit-learn.

Features

Data Preprocessing: Cleans and formats the dataset for model training.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes feature distributions and correlations.

k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) Model: Implements and evaluates a k-NN classifier.

Performance Metrics: Computes accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports.

Data Visualization: Generates scatter plots and feature analysis.

Dataset

Source: Breast Cancer Coimbra Data Set

Format: CSV file (dataR2.csv)

Features: 10 clinical attributes, such as BMI, glucose level, and insulin levels

Target Variable: Classification (0 = Healthy, 1 = Cancerous)

Installation

To run the project, ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed.

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib

Usage

Run the Jupyter Notebook to execute the model training and evaluation:

jupyter notebook main.ipynb

Results

The model achieves an accuracy of X% (replace with actual value) using k-NN with optimized hyperparameters. The confusion matrix and accuracy score validate the model's performance.
